# Dotfiles

Currently working on a system for seamless backup and deployment of configuration files. Already have a simple backup script but that's all. I am exploring different options, maybe Stow and symbolic links would be a good start.

My dotfiles are copied to "~/.dotfiles" ($DOTFILES). To use Stow, each directory inside the .dotfiles must represent the home directory. Stow will follow the relative path when deploying a symlink. Each configuration directory inside the .dotfiles directory must hold the same relative path from the home directory. Reference: [[01_Reference/software/stow the dotfiles|stow the dotfiles]].

>If original file is under `$HOME/.config/ranger/rc.conf` than copy must got into `~/.dotfiles/ranger/.config/ranger/rc.conf`. Instead of $HOME you have `~/.dotfiles/ranger`.

## TODO

- [+] Initialize git repository
- [+] Setup remote repository
- [ ] Generate symlinks with stow
