# Dotfiles

Currently working on a system for seamless backup and deployment of configuration files. Already have a simple backup script but that's all. I am exploring different options, maybe Stow and symbolic links would be a good start.

My dotfiles are copied to "~/.dotfiles" ($DOTFILES). To use Stow i need same structure of paths. When creating symlinks, Stow also follows the relative paths.

>If original file is under `~/.config/ranger/rc.conf` than copy must got into `~/.dotfiles/ranger/rc.conf`. Stow will follow the relative path when deploying a symlink. Reference: [[linux/stow the dotfiles|stow the dotfiles]]




## TODO


- [] initialize git repository
- [] setup remote repository
