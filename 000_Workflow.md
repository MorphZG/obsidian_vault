# My Obsidian Workflow

Even the longest journey starts with a single step. I was searching for way to organise knowledge and remember it somehow and there is a lot of very good systems that can help. But maybe the best option is to find the system you like and then customise it and reorganise it to fit your needs.

## Directories

- **00_Fleeting_inbox**
Fleeting notes or inbox directory is a place where fresh notes start. This is a starting point where i put notes that still need to be refined. From here i can 
- **01_Reference**
This directory is for practical knowledge. From tools and software to life and philosophy. 
- **02_Ideas**
These are my own ideas i have about something. Something i find interesting about something. Like a cooking pot with different ingredients, almost ready to be served. As opposed to references, these are my own views of particular subject which can but don't have to be right, where references are exact and practical knowledge about the subject.
- **03_Knowledge**
Here i have more broad texts about single topic. Permanent knowledge base. Even though i can consider this to be a complete set of articles or texts i will always expand and adapt each article as i learn more about the subject. Like a living organism.
- **04_Expressions**
After collecting enough knowledge and different ideas, when there is enough to encapsulate the written words into expression of my own.  Something i am willing to share to the online word. This is the directory where everything comes together.

## Markdown

Obsidian uses a standard markdown with few of it's own additions: [[01_Reference/obsidian markdown|obsidian markdown]]
