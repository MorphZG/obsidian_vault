# Obsidian notes

Git repository for my notes. Still looking for a way to logically organize my thoughts. Currently there are few directories for each topic. Every note is written using plain markdown syntax with yaml front matter. Most important property of every note are tags where each note can have maximum of three.

Since there is still no designated workflow, notes have minimal structure. While trying not to shoot myself in a foot and staying organized until i find a pragmatic workflow.

## Installation

- Download Obsidian app from [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).
- Clone the repository and open it as vault.

```sh

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MorphZG/obsidian_vault.git
```

- After starting the Obsidian you must create your own vault or open the existing one. Vaults are just directories that holds your notes as markdown files.
 
## Workflow

Link to my [[000_Workflow|note taking workflow]] with Obsidian. It will possibly change a few times as it did already. Main goal is to keep it pragmatic with focus on simplicity.
