# Three reading levels

**Inspectional reading**: Reading to quickly scope out a text or information to prime yourself for deeper reading
**Analytical reading**: Reading to deeply analyze a single text. Understand and focus.
**Synoptical reading**: Reading by putting multiple books in conversation with each other. Further discussion to develop novel insight and new perspectives.
