# Job hunting for junior devs


## Building projects

- Build projects, document them properly and make them publicly accessible. 
- Good practice would be using git, version control system, and publish on github. 
-  Each github repository should have a readme file or even docs directory with complete documentation of the project. Through my interaction with other open source projects i have found a good way to structure the readme.

### Example of a good readme.md file

```md
# Project Title

## Introduction

- Overview: Briefly describe what the project does and it's purpose.
- Motivation: Explain why you built this project. What problem does it solve or what need does it fulfill
- Screenshots

- How the project works?
- Explain the mechanics and processes that are maybe not so obvious.
- List available features and everything user can benefit from.

## Installation

- Prerequisites needed to run the project (e.g. Node.js, npm, Pyrhon...)
- Provide step by step instructions on how to install and set up the project locally

## Usage
